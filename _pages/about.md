Hello! I'm a an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience) at McGill University. I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow with the [Evidence in Governance and Politics](https://egap.org) network at [Toronto Metropolitan University](https://www.torontomu.ca). I earned my PhD in the [Department of Politics](http://as.nyu.edu/politics.html) at New York University in 2024. 

My research sits at the intersection of political behaviour, public opinion, and race, ethnicity and politics. I study how information shapes people's beliefs, attitudes and behaviours, with a specific interest in how they update their views toward out-groups. Focusing primarily on Canada and the United States, [my work](/research/) explores how members of dominant groups think about historical injustices committed against others in the past. I employ a range of research designs and data sources, including experiments, surveys, observational data, and text-as-data methods.
